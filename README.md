> **Monitoring Anomalies. Protecting Reality.**  
> A classified, browser-based incident command console designed to track strange events and rising threats in and around Hawkins.

# 🚨 Overview

Strange things are happening in Hawkins.

Power grids fluctuate without cause.
People vanish.
Reality itself shows signs of fracture.

The Hawkins Incident Command Console is a single-page, frontend-only web application that simulates a real-world emergency operations dashboard used by Hawkins authorities and laboratory personnel to monitor, analyze, and respond to abnormal incidents.

This project blends technical implementation, UI/UX design, and story-driven interaction to create an immersive operational control system — not just another CRUD app.

✔ Frontend only
✔ No backend
✔ Real-time UI interactions
✔ Immersive, narrative-driven design

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Hawkins can no longer rely on walkie-talkies, paper reports, or guesswork.

Authorities need a centralized digital system to:

Log abnormal incidents

Assess threat severity

Track investigation status

Monitor city-wide danger levels

React immediately to critical events

The objective of this project is to design a browser-based Incident Command Console that feels:

Operational

Urgent

Classified

Believable

---
# 🚀 Core Features
# 🗂️ Incident Feed

A live feed of all reported anomalies across Hawkins jurisdiction.

Each incident includes:

Incident title

Location

Threat level (Low / Medium / Critical)

Status (Open / Investigating / Contained)

Time logged

Incidents are visually styled to reflect their severity for instant recognition.

---
# 🔍 Advanced Filtering & Sorting

Operators can quickly narrow down incidents using:

Threat level filters

Status filters

Sort order (Latest → Oldest)

This enables rapid situational awareness during escalating crises.

---
# 🧾 Classified Incident File Panel

Clicking an incident opens a restricted-access classified file.

Displayed information includes:

Full incident description

Assigned officer

Status & threat classification

Operational tags (Reality Breach Risk, High Containment Risk, etc.)

Recommended response actions

The panel is intentionally designed to resemble an official confidential report, complete with clearance warnings.

---
# ➕ New Incident Logging

Operators can log new incidents directly from the console.

Features:

Structured input form

Instant UI update

Confirmation feedback after submission

Optional localStorage persistence

No backend required (client-side simulation)

----

# ⚠️ Global Threat Level Monitor

A dedicated Threat Level Meter aggregates all active incidents and displays the overall danger level across Hawkins.

🟢 Low — Controlled

🟡 Medium — Elevated risk

🔴 Critical — Emergency conditions

When thresholds are exceeded, the system issues alerts such as:

---
# ⚠ REALITY BREACH IMMINENT
Critical incidents exceed safe containment levels.

This converts raw incident data into actionable intelligence.

🌑 Upside Down Mode

A special immersive mode representing dimensional instability.

Visual & UX Changes:

Darker, distorted color palette

Increased contrast and atmospheric effects

Enhanced emphasis on critical incidents

Subtle scan-line and glitch-inspired visuals

---

# 🎹 Keyboard Shortcut

Press U to toggle Upside Down Mode instantly

This feature enhances immersion without using copyrighted assets.

---

# 🎨 Design Philosophy

Inspired by real emergency and military control rooms

Focused on clarity, urgency, and hierarchy of information

Cinematic, story-driven UI without sacrificing usability

Stranger Things–inspired atmosphere (no logos or fonts used)

Every UI element serves a functional purpose.

---

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5

CSS3

Vanilla JavaScript

LocalStorage (optional persistence)

No frameworks.
No backend.
Pure frontend engineering.

----

# 📱 Responsiveness

Fully responsive layout

Optimized for:

Desktop control-room view

Tablet usage

Mobile screens

----
# 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out

✔ More than a dashboard — a narrative system
✔ Realistic emergency-console design
✔ Creative threat visualization
✔ Keyboard interactions & live UI feedback
✔ Beginner-friendly implementation with professional polish

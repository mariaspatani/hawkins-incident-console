> **Monitoring Anomalies. Protecting Reality.**  
> A classified, browser-based incident command console designed to track strange events and rising threats in and around Hawkins.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Hawkins Incident Command Console** is a single-page web application built to simulate a **real-world emergency operations dashboard** used by Hawkins authorities.

As unexplained incidents increase — power anomalies, dimensional breaches, missing persons, and unknown lifeforms — traditional communication methods are no longer sufficient.  
This console acts as a **centralized digital control room** for monitoring, logging, and responding to these incidents.

✔ Frontend only  
✔ No backend  
✔ Fully interactive  
✔ Story-driven UI

## 🎯 Problem Statement (Simplified)

Hawkins requires a modern system to:
- Log abnormal incidents
- Track threat severity
- Monitor investigation status
- Respond quickly to critical dangers

The goal of this project is to design a **browser-based Incident Command Console** that feels realistic, immersive, and operational — not just a basic CRUD application.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🗂️ Incident List
- Displays all reported incidents
- Each incident includes:
  - Title
  - Location
  - Threat Level (Low / Medium / Critical)
  - Status (Open / Investigating / Contained)
  - Timestamp

### 🔍 Filtering & Sorting
- Filter incidents by:
  - Threat Level
  - Status
- Sort by:
  - Latest incidents
  - Oldest incidents

---

### 🧾 Classified Incident Details Panel
- Clicking an incident opens a **classified file view**
- Displays:
  - Full description
  - Auto-generated tags
  - Assigned officer
  - Recommended action
- Designed to resemble an official confidential report

---

### ➕ New Incident Logging
- Add new incidents using an in-app form
- Live update to the incident list
- Confirmation message after submission
- Client-side only (optional localStorage persistence)

---

## ⚠️ Hawkins Threat Level Meter (Creative Feature)

A global **Threat Level Meter** visually represents the overall danger level in Hawkins.

- Low threat → minimal impact
- Medium threat → warning indicators
- Critical threat → alert visuals

When danger exceeds safe limits:
> ⚠ **“Reality Breach Imminent”**

This transforms raw data into **meaningful situational awareness**.

## 🌑 Upside Down Mode

A special immersive mode inspired by dimensional instability.

### Visual Effects:
- Darker, distorted color palette
- Subtle blur and scan-line effects
- Incident cards visually react based on threat severity

### 🎹 Keyboard Shortcut
- Press **U** to toggle Upside Down Mode

This feature enhances immersion and storytelling without relying on copyrighted assets.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- Inspired by real emergency control rooms
- Focus on clarity, urgency, and immersion
- Stranger Things–inspired atmosphere (no logos or fonts used)
- Every interaction designed to feel **intentional and cinematic**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- No frameworks
- No backend
- Fully client-side logic

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

- Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out

✔ Not just functional — immersive  
✔ Story-driven dashboard design  
✔ Real-time operational feel  
✔ Creative UI interactions  
✔ Beginner-friendly yet competition-ready
